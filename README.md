# WhatsApp Clone Project Plan

## Introduction

This project is a full-stack WhatsApp-like chat application that allows users to send messages, make voice and video calls, send and receive multimedia files, and manage user accounts. The goal is to create a feature-rich chat application with all the basic and advanced features found in WhatsApp, along with a few unique features.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (for web), React Native (for mobile), WebSocket (for real-time communication), Redux (state management)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, WebSocket for real-time communication
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing user data, messages, media, etc.)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage or AWS S3 (for storing media files)
- **Voice/Video Calls**: WebRTC or third-party APIs (e.g., Twilio, Agora)
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

## Basic Features

1. **User Authentication**: 
   - Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
   - Passwords are securely hashed and stored.
   - JWT is used for authentication.

2. **Real-Time Messaging**:
   - Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
   - WebSocket or Socket.io will be used to handle real-time communication.

3. **Group Chats**:
   - Users can create group chats with multiple participants.
   - Admins can manage group settings, including adding/removing users.

4. **Media Sharing**:
   - Users can send and receive images, videos, audio files, and documents.
   - Media files are stored securely in Firebase Storage or AWS S3.

5. **Push Notifications**:
   - Users will receive push notifications for new messages and call alerts.

6. **Voice and Video Calls**:
   - Users can make real-time voice and video calls.
   - WebRTC or a third-party API like Twilio or Agora will be used to implement this feature.

7. **Status (Story)**:
   - Users can post status updates (stories) that disappear after 24 hours.
   - Stories can be text, image, or video-based.

## Additional Features

1. **Block User Feature**:
   - **Description**: Allow users to block other users, preventing them from sending messages or interacting with the user in any way.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - Add a "Block User" option in the user profile.
     - Store blocked users in the database with a reference to the user.
     - On the backend, check if a user is blocked before allowing them to send a message.
     - On the frontend, hide the blocked user's messages and prevent new messages from being received from the blocked user.

2. **Background Change (Theme Customization)**:
   - **Description**: Allow users to change the chat background or theme to customize the look and feel of their chat screen.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - Add an option in the settings to change the background or theme (light/dark mode).
     - Store the user's preference in the database or local storage.
     - Apply the selected background or theme across the app.

3. **Conversation Type Change**:
   - **Description**: Enable users to switch between different types of conversation (e.g., text-based, voice, or video) during an active chat.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Provide buttons in the chat interface to switch between text, voice, and video modes.
     - Use WebRTC or a third-party service for switching between video and voice calls.
     - For text, ensure that the chat interface updates dynamically to accommodate voice/video features.

4. **Get All Images, Links, and Files Separately**:
   - **Description**: Extract all media files (images, links, and documents) shared in a conversation and display them separately in the chat.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Filter messages for media types (image, video, link, document).
     - Store the media separately and create a dedicated UI for displaying all images, links, and files shared in the chat.

5. **Sending Voice Messages**:
   - **Description**: Enable users to send voice messages within the chat.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Integrate Web Audio API or use libraries like `react-native-audio` to record audio messages.
     - Allow the user to press and hold a button to record, and send the audio as a message once released.
     - Play the voice message in the chat when received.

6. **Stories (Status Updates)**:
   - **Description**: Allow users to post status updates (similar to WhatsApp Stories) that disappear after 24 hours.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create a UI for posting and viewing status updates, which are visible to other users for a limited time.
     - Store the status updates in the database with an expiration time (e.g., 24 hours).
     - Show the status updates in a separate section or at the top of the chat list.

7. **Story Reactions**:
   - **Description**: Allow users to react to a status update (story) using emojis or reactions.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Add reaction options (emojis) to each status update.
     - Allow users to click on a status and react by selecting an emoji.
     - Store reactions in the database and display them to the story owner.

## Final Thoughts

### Backend Changes:
- Update the database schema to store information about blocked users, story status, and reactions.
- Integrate media storage solutions like Firebase Storage or AWS S3.

### Frontend Changes:
- Design the UI components for blocking users, changing the background, and viewing media files.
- Implement real-time updates using Socket.io for chat and story reactions.

### Testing:
- Test the app thoroughly, particularly for real-time features like voice messages and story updates.

### Some update
- add polling system
- add event system
- and others
